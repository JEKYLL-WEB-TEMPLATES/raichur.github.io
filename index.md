I love learning things, building things, and solving problems. I'm passionate about technology and design and how the two intersect, and I specialize in the web and iOS.

My daily objective is straightforward: I want to be smarter than I was yesterday. Read [my manifesto](/manifesto).

In my down time, I work on side projects, read, take pictures, listen to podcasts, play guitar, and kick a football around. I'm 17 years old and currently live in Bangalore, India with my family.
