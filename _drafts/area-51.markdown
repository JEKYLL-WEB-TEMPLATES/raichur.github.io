# Area 51
Area 51, or Groom Lake, is in Nevada. The reason why it's in Nevada is because a dry lake bed is extremely flat and make it difficult to Spot. It's the most famous secret facility. Though the activities in the facility are more secretive. The lack of transparency causes speculation.

# The beginning
During World War Two, the us was looking for places to land aircrafts for military purposes.  It's within 159 miles of Las Vegas. The original purpose of the facility was a training facility created by the army "aircore". After the war, they left the facility.
In the 1950's, there was the rise of the Cold War (not an armed conflict, but a political conflict and spying). Also, competition and development if new nuclear weapons. The grid of land in Nevada was used to develop new nuclear weapons. That grid had 30 squares. Each square was called an area. This the former army aircore facility was adjacent to allot called area 15. It's possible that the name area 51 came from transposing area 15.
