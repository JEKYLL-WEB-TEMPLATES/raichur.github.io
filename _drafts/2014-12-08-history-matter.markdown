## Pre-Socratic philosophy
The first recorded speculators of the underlying nature of the visible world were the pre-Socratic philosophers of ancient Greece. The term pre-Socratic refers to a group of philosophers  who lived prior-to and during the life of Socrates. They were primarily focused on [metaphysics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) and [cosmogony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony). The original writing of these pre-Socratics have been mostly lost, so we know them largely through fragments and references from other ancient sources.

> “If we would understand sixth century philosophers, we must first disabuse our minds of the atomistic conception of dead matter in mechanical motion and of the Cartesian dualism of matter and mind.”
— Francis Cornford

Though their ideas may seem primitive, childish, and sometimes absurd, the ancient Greeks are the intellectual and cultural ancestors of western civilisation. In them we find a blend of highly abstract thought through simple observation. They laid the foundation of western philosophy and much of their teachings are fundamental to understanding atomic theory.

### The Milesians
Anaximenes, Anaximander and Thales — whose theories are described below — are also known as the Milesians. All three of these philosophers lived in the city of Miletus in the 6th century BCE. The Milesians are called “physiologists” because they attempted to provide a rational account (_logos_) of nature (_physis_), hence the word physiologist (different from the modern meaning of the term).

#### _All three of the Milesians were interested in the fundamental question: “What is the world made of?”_
Looking out into the world, they noticed two fundamental characteristics of matter:

1. **The universal fluxility of matter.**
  <br/> The constant change we observe in nature.

2. **The infinite plurality of matter.**
  <br/> In other words, anything that exists is different than anything that exists, has existed, or will ever exist. The world displays infinite variation.

When the Milesians asked themselves what the world was made of, they concluded that underlying the infinite plurality of the world was a single, permanent substance. They proposed that everything in the world was made of the same material. Despite its infinite variation, this material always retailed its unity and fundamental identity. They called this the _arche_ (ἀρχή — meaning “beginning” or “origin”).

> “‘First principle’ translates the Greek _arche_, but it could also have rendered as “origin”, “source”, “beginning”, and significantly, “ruler”. The _arche_ is the origin and continues to exhibit authority”.
— David Roochnik

The _arche_ was thought of by the Milesians as being a corporeal material. At the same time, this substance was thought to be alive, intelligent, divine, and “endowed with spirit”. The view that matter is imbued with intelligence and life is called _Hylozoism_ (_hylē_ matter + _zōos_ alive). With respect to the question “What is the _arche_ made of?”, though, each Milesian had a different answer. We will explore their perspectives and the perspectives of other notable pre-Socratic philosophers in the following paragraphs.

### Thales of Miletus (c. 624 BCE — c. 546 BCE)
> “Western philosophy begins with Thales.”
— Bertrand Russell

Thales was the first to attempt to explain natural phenomena without reference to mythology whereby was given credit for being the first western philosopher. He hypothesised that the originating material substance of matter, the _arche_, was water. He said that every other things that we see around us has taken it’s form from water and will eventually return to it.

> “[Thales] supposition may have arisen from the observation that the nurture of all creatures is moist, and that warmth itself is generated from moisture and lives by it; and from which all things come to be…”
— Aristotle

However, since so little is known about Thales, Aristotle’s explanation is mere conjecture. All we can safely say with any certainty is that he thought that everything in the world was made of water.

### Anaximander of Miletus (c. 610 BCE — c. 546 BCE)
We know more about the theories of Anaximander, a successor of Thales. Anaximander couldn’t tolerate the volatility of water as being something that was supposed to be the foundation of all existence. Where is it that these things come from? It is illogical to think that they came out of nothing, so what was creating them? Where did they go when they disappear? If something cannot be created out of nothing, it cannot disappear into nothingness either.
Anaximander therefore decided that the _arche_ was the _apeiron_ (ἄπειρον — meaning “limitless”, “infinite”, “boundless” or “indefinite”), rather than a particular element (like water — which Thales had held).
Anaximander thought the world we experience was made out of two pairs of opposites: The hot and cold, and the wet and the dry. The two pairs of opposites were proposed by Anaximander to be originally mixed together in the _apeiron_. Hence, the _apeiron_ is not a definite thing, but instead is indefinite. He said that all four elements are mixed together to form an undifferentiated mass.
Anaximander said that the _apeiron_ was engaged in “eternal motion”. He said that these opposites are separated out of their potential state in the _apeiron_, and in doing so form the world as we know it. This process of the elements separating in and out of the _apeiron_ was continuous, and could explain the flux we perceive in this world. As things are constantly being born from the _apeiron_, simultaneously other things are dying and returning back into it. The _apeiron_ thus forms all things and properties of nature and receives them back unto itself when they pass away. The _apeiron_ always has been and always will be, and we are unaware of its constant presence because it has not definite traits by which it could be perceived by, and yet all the things we see in the universe come out of it.

> “Anaximander of Miletus, son of Praxiades, says that the first principle of existing things is the Boundless; for from this all things come into being and into all perish. Wherefore innumerable worlds are brought to birth and again dissolved into that out of which they came.”
— Aëtius

### Anaximenes of Miletus (c. 585 BCE — c. 528 BCE)
Anaximenes proposed that the _arche_ was air or _pneuma_. In calling the _arche_ a definite element, he seems to have failed to grasp Anaximander’s insight that if the _arche_ is to exist, it must be an indefinite substance. However, some claim that Anaximenes theory represents an advancement on Thales and Anaximander because unlike his predecessors, he gave a scientific explanation as to how the _arche_, air in his case, transforms into all the things we perceive as existing in the world. Anaximenes utilised the physical processes of condensation (physical state change from gaseous to liquid state) and vaporisation (physical state change from liquid to gaseous state). He reasoned that if air can be condensed into water, water can be condensed further into earth and rock. Following that same line of reasoning, he said that if water can be turned back into air, it could be further vaporised into fire.

### Heraclitus of Ephesus (c. 535 BCE — c. 475 BCE)
After Parmenides (who we will study later), Heraclitus possibly had the most enigmatic of ideas. Ancient philosophers struggled mightily to decipher his paradoxical theories, subsequently naming him “The Riddler”. While all the other pre-Socratics derived philosophical systems by building on the ideas of their predecessors, Heraclitus is believed to have arrived at his ideas solely through inner contemplation and self-sought isolation.

> “He was no man’s disciple, but said that he had searched himself  and learned everything from himself”
— Diogenes

Heraclitus’ vision of reality is encapsulated in three different intertwined ideas:

1. **Everything is in flux**

>“Ever-newer waters flow on those who step into the same rivers.”
  — Heraclitus
  This statement is not merely an observation about rivers, but symbolic about the nature of reality. He meant that everything in the world is constantly changing and is infinitely plural in nature.

2. **The world is an ever-living fire**
  <br/>There is much debate regarding exactly what Heraclitus meant by this statement. Some have taken a more conservative approach, claiming that he meant it merely as a symbolic description of the world. Since everything is observed in a continual flux, then fire serves as an apt symbol for the ceaseless change that is occurring in objects which appear stable. However, others believed that Heraclitus meant that fire was the _arche_.

  > “All things are exchanged for fire and fire for all things, just as wares for gold and gold for wares.”
  — Heraclitus

3. **War is the father of all**
  <br/>Everything that comes into existence, Heraclitus thought, comes through the destruction of something else.

  > “Fire lives in the death of earth, air lives in the death of fire, water lives in the death of air, and earth in the death of water.”
  — Heraclitus

  Heraclitus associated fire with the divine and eternal cosmos, the life-giving Sun, lightning, the moon, and other bright energies of the upper atmosphere. He believed that every human soul comes from a tiny amount of this heavenly fire. Fire creates all all elements by transforming into them by a certain downward path. Fire condenses to become air, the vapors condense to become water, and water, finally, condenses to form earth. The elements can also follow the reverse path, going from earth back to eternal fire.

### Parmenides of Elea (c. 515/540 BCE — c. 450 BCE)
_Get ready for a mind-numbing verbal journey!_
Parmenides elaborated on perhaps the most absurd metaphysical account of reality in the history of philosophy. Although his theories were paradoxical, he is thought of as the most influential of the pre-Socratics.

> “Pre-Socratic philosophy is divided into two halves by the name of Parmenides. His exceptional powers of reason brought speculation about the origin and constitution of the universe to a halt, and [forced] it to make a fresh start on different lines.”
— William Guthrie

He refused to think of the world as in constant flux, in fact, he arrived at an opposite conclusion which runs counter to the theory of Anaximander, who believed in “eternal motion”. Parmenides refused to believe in all the motion and change before our eyes, and made a perplexing conclusion: A world without any movement; a universe which actually never changes at all. He believed that reality is different from the way it appears to our senses. He said that the invisible “real” world was motionless at all times. Stranger still, he said that the “real” world consisted of only one substance (monism) —  the distinction we see of all the different elements is just an illusion. In essence, he believed that _reality is an illusion_. Take a moment to digest that.
Parmenides was much unlike other pre-Socratics who supported their reasoning with empirical observations. He was an extreme rationalist — he was intensely concerned with pure logic. He believed that our senses give us faulty information, and in order to grasp the truth, we must rely solely on our mind and the power of reasoning — viewing everything through the “mind’s eye”.
How did he come up with such a conclusion? His argument came from a very simple premise: it is an irrational to state that something does not exist, but it is intelligent to state what does exist instead.

> “The only roads of enquiry there are to think of: one, that it is and that it is not possible for it not to be, this is the path of persuasion (for truth is its companion); the other, that it is not and that it must not be — this I say to you is a path wholly unknowable.”
— Parmenides

The concept that it is irrational to state that something does not exist is obviously incorrect, however this is probably not what Parmenides was getting at. A common interpretation of that idea says that he was stating that it is impossible to for a concept of “nothingness”. Parmenides looked back on his predecessors and observed that they spoke of things born into the world and perishing from it as if it were the most natural process. However, Parmenides believed that this concept of things being born, changing, and dying out of nothing — “becoming” — was an incoherent concept.

### Empedocles of Acragas (c. 490 BCE — c. 430 BCE)
As studied earlier, Parmenides theorised that it is impossible for something to come out of nothing. Empedocles agreed, and further stated that there are 4 categories of elementary particles, called the “roots” of all things: fire (_Shining Zeus_), air (_life-bringing Hera_), earth (_Aidoneus_), and water (_Nestis_). He proposed that these roots are eternal, innumerable, and indestructible. He also claimed that these roots do not change and are both qualitatively and quantitatively immutable. He said that the myriad of things in the cosmos was produced by various proportions and compositions of the roots mixed together.

> “… There is no birth of any mortal things, nor any end in baneful death, but only mingling and separation of what is mingled; birth is the name given to these by men.”
— Empedocles

_[Animated GIF goes here]_

Along with the 4 roots, Empedocles postulated the existence of 2 forces of the cosmos: Love and Strife. Love is the force of attraction, which causes the roots to come closer together and mingle harmoniously. Strife, on the other hand, is the force of repulsion, which repels the roots and causes them to seek for their own kind.

> “In Anger [Strife] all are diverse and sundered, but in Love they come together and are desired of each other. For out of these are born whatever was and is and will be — trees, men, women, beasts, birds and water-feeding fishes, yea the long-lived gods highest in honours. There are just these, but running through one another they alter their appearance: so far does mixture effect change.”
— Empedocles

#### The eternal cosmic cycle
The powers of Love and Strife are engaged in an eternal battle. The universe passes through a set of 4 stages in this cycle:

1. **The rule of Love**
<br/>This is the stage ben the power of Love is wholly dominant, and Strife is banned to the outer confines of the cosmos, impotent in its attempt to influence the roots. Solely influenced by the power of Love, all the roots are mingled together in a unity, forming a sphere. He thought that under the rule of Love, the cosmos was in it’s most divine state.

2. **The advancement of Strife**
<br/>When Strife begins to influence the elements, the sphere is disrupted and movement is initiated. Under the influence of Strive, the roots begin to separate and commence the arrangement of a cosmos composed of different compositions of the roots.
  He believed that creates collections of water roots (Seas, rivers, lakes), collections of air roots (Sky), collections of earth roots (land) were created under the influence of Strife. Furthermore, he said that the existence of living creatures is evidence that Love is still present. Each living creature is constituted by a specific ratio of the four different roots. This is the cosmic stage that Empedocles believed that we are in.

3. **The rule of Strife**
<br/>In the future, Empedocles proposed, Strife would rule , banishing Love to the outer ends of the cosmos (just as Strife once was).  

4. **The advancement of Love**
<br/>Love will make it’s way back into the fold, and produce another cosmos like our own.
  A world like our own (where there exists a myriad of living creatures) is created either in stage 2 or 4 of the cosmic cycle. If this is so, why did Empedocles believe that our world was in the stage of advancing Strive? The answer to this question can be found by understanding that along with Love and Strife influencing the natural elements of the cosmos, Empedocles conceived of the two forces as exerting a moral influence. It compelled individuals to behave virtuously (Love) and destructively (Strife). He therefore believed that the world was in a stage of advancing Strife because he was appalled by the atrocious works of the human race -at the time-.

### Democritus of Abdera (c. 460 BCE — c. 370 BCE)
Democritus is the last of the pre-Socratics, most famous for being one of the founders of the philosophical doctrine known as atomism, also called the particulate theory of matter. The supposed teacher of Democritus, Leucippus, is often heralded as the founder of atomism. However, nothing else is known about Leucippus and some ancient philosophers even denied his existence. It is virtually impossible to distinguish which ideas were unique to who, and thus most people attribute the theory of atomism to Democritus alone.
The pre-Socratics influence on Plato and Aristotle is well know, but the ideas of Democritus are somewhat unique of the pre-Socratics in that his theory, atomism, also influenced the mechanical philosophy (c. 1620 — c. 1650), an aspect of the scientific revolution. Derived from atomism, mechanical philosophy was reworked by 17th century thinkers such as Descartes, Gassendi, Huygens, Hooke, Newton, Galileo, Boyle, and many others. While many ideas of the mechanical philosophers have been abandoned, the idea that matter is composed of building blocks called atoms remained prominent up until the 20th century.

> “If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis that all things are made of atoms — little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.”
— Richard Feynman

Out of all the pre-Socratics, Democritus undoubtedly deserves the epithet polymath — He is said to have written over 60 works on topics ranging from ethics, physics, medicine, epistemology, music theory, geography, painting, etc. He is most famous for ideating that the world was made up of “Atoms and Void”. The word atom comes from the Greek word _Atomos_ which combines the privative “a”, with the verb “tomos”, meaning “to split”. Therefore, the word atomos means “unsplittable”.
Democritus considered atoms as the fundamental building blocks of the universe, and were indivisible, solid, and indestructible. He said that atoms existed in “the void”, meaning nothing or empty space. All things in this world are created when atoms collide and get tangled with each other. He said that there are infinite number of atoms, and an infinite number of kinds of atoms. Concerning the density of matter, he reasoned that the solidity of matter depends on the shape of the atoms involved. Thus, gold atoms are solid with strong “hooks” that lock them in place; water atoms are “smooth”; salt atoms, because of their taste, were “sharp”; and air atoms are “whirling”. This theory of the atom, also known as the Democritean atom, was an solid which only interacted with other atoms mechanically.
Contrary to Anaximander who believed that the world was made from 4 opposites —hot and cold, wet and dry — Democritus believed that atoms were devoid of all qualities, i.e. hotness, coldness, wetness, and dryness.

Instead, he proposed that atoms were defined by 3 quantitative measures:
1. Shape
2. Arrangement
3. Position

But then the obvious question arises, how can something defined solely by qualitative measures give rise to our experience of qualities?
To answer this, we must understand the difference of _physis_ (nature) and _nomos_ (convention). What exists by _physis_ is objective and would exist independently of human beings. However, what exists by _nomos_ is something which is an artificial human construction and dependant on the human mind for its existence.
Now, Democritus thought that the qualities we experience do not exist objectively but by _nomos_, and arise when the atoms of the world interact with the atoms of our body.

> “By convention sweet, by convention bitter, by convention hot, by convention cold, by convention color: but in reality atoms and void.”
— Democritus

> “I think, therefore, that these tastes, odors, colors, etc., so far as their objective existence is concerned, are nothing but mere names for something which resides exclusively in our sensitive body (corpo sensitivo), so that if the perceiving creatures were removed, all of these qualities would be annihilated and abolished from existence. But just because we have given special names to these qualities, different from the names we have given to the primary and real properties, we are tempted into believing that the former really and truly exist as well as the latter.”
— Galileo Galilei

Though Democritus was the first pioneer of atomic theory, he was not able to definitively prove it. It was only c. 2000 years later that his hypothesis would be further developed.
