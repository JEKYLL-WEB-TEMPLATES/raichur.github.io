Instead of setting 10 resolutions that I try to achieve simultaneously at the beginning of the year, I decided to focus on creating one new habit every month this year.

Habits to create in 2015:

1. <del>**January:** Programming every day.</del> <span class="success">Completed successfully!</span>
2. **February:** Meditating every day.
3. **March:** Waking up early.
4. **April:** Reading every day.
5. **May:** Focus.
6. **June:** Writing every day.
7. **July:** Emotional hygiene.
8. **August:** Un-procrastination.
9. **September:** Evening routine.
10. **October:** Writing every day.
11. **November:** Gratitude.
12. **December:** Contentment.
