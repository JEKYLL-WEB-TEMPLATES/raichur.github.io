title: 'Habits to create in 2015'
---

Instead of setting 10 resolutions that I try to achieve simultaneously at the beginning of the year, I decided to focus on creating one new habit every month this year. The hard work required to create the habit increases gradually from month to month, so I hope to gain confidence to tackle the tougher habits after trumping the easier ones. 

Habits to create in 2015: 

1. **January:** Programming every day.
2. **February:** Meditating every day.
3. **March:** Waking up early.
4. **April:** Reading every day.
5. **May:** Singletask.
6. **June:** Contentment.
7. **July:** 
8. **August:** Exercising every alternate day.
9. **September:** 
10. **October:** 
11. **November:** 
12. **December:**
