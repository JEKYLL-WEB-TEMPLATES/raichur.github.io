title: 'Habits to create in 2015'

Instead of setting 10 resolutions that I try to achieve simultaneously at the beginning of the year, I decided to focus on creating one new habit every month this year. 

Habits to create in 2015: 

1. **January:** Programming every day.
2. **February:** Meditating every day.
3. **March:** Waking up early.
4. **April:** Reading every day.
5. **May:** Singletask.
6. **June:**  Eat healthy.
7. **July:** Declutter.
8. **August:** Un-procrastination.
9. **September:** Evening routine.
10. **October:** Exercising every alternate day.
11. **November:** Gratitude.
12. **December:** Contentment.
