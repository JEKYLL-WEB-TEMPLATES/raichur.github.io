At the beginning of this year I set out to build twelve habits; one for each month. The reason why I set out to change my habits was because habits define our lives-what we repeatedly do ultimately forms who we are. Consistently performing behaviors that improve your skills will help you achieve mastery in the long run. Halfway into the year, I’ve been successful so far in forming the habits I set out to form. Here’s what I’ve learnt in the process:

* Commit to doing it daily
* Schedule the time
* Start small
* Give yourself a reward
* Eliminate disruptions and distractions
