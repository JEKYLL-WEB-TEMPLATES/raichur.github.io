## What is contentment?

The answer to that question seems as elusive as achieving it. We an intuitively tell whether or not we are content, but what is it?

Here's what the dictionary says:


> ## con·tent·ment
A state of happiness and satisfaction.

<br/>

In [this video][1], Henri Nouwen talks about three sources that we normally to for contentment or happiness.

They are based on different ways to answer the fundamental question of “Who am I?”:

<br/>

1. **I am what I do.**
2. **I am what other people think about me.**
3. **I am what I have.**

<br/>

These benchmarks can make you happy, but only for the now. You will later find out that other people have done much more than you, much better things than you, and have much more than you.

**So how can we achieve real contentment?**

<div class="middle">Contentment = Reality / Expectation</div>

Real contentment comes by understanding the realities that you are surrounded by and not comparing your life to someone else's that you are convinced is “living the dream”.

Instead, strive for greatness.

Always remain appreciative of what you have. Be content in the moment.
