Instead of setting 12 resolutions that I try to achieve simultaneously at the beginning of the year, I decided to focus on creating one new habit every month this year.

Habits to create in 2015:

1. <del>**January:** Programming every day.</del> <span class="success">Completed successfully!</span>
2. <del>**February:** Meditating every day.</del> <span class="success">Completed successfully!</span>
3. <del>**March:** Waking up early every day.</del> <span class="fail">Failed. I was unwell for two weeks, but that's no excuse.</span>
4. <del>**April:** Reading every day + Waking up early every day <i>(Attempt #2)</i>.</del> <span class="success">Completed successfully!</span>
5. <del>**May:** Focus.</del> <span class="success">Completed successfully!</span>
6. <del>**June:** Writing every day.</del> <span class="success">Completed successfully. I'm still a terrible writer, but I'm working on it!</span>
7. **July:** Emotional hygiene.
