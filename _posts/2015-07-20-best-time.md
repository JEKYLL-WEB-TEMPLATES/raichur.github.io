Although I've given the time of day for each of the following activities, it's important to note that these are for the average person. For example, if you sleep polyphasically and wake up at 2 AM (like me), **you are not considered average**.

# Exercise


<br/>

# Take a Nap

### Time: 1 PM - 3 PM (for _most people[^2]_).
Dr. Sara Mednick, a sleep researcher, says that the best time to nap depends on when you wake up. Those who wake up 5 AM should nap at 1 PM, and those who wake up at 7 PM shouldn't nap until 2 PM[^1]. It's also worth noting that 20 minutes is the optimal nap time.
