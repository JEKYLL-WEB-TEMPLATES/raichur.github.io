> “I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.”

– Albert Einstein

I was always curious about how things worked, even as a kid. When I was introduced to computers in my early teenage years, I would tinker with them to somehow get a better understanding of how it worked. It was a struggle of trial and error, but I got a good shot of dopamine when I would solve a problem or understood a concept. I enjoyed the process of learning.

In the end, it's your curiosity that drives self-directed learning.

Autodidactism, by definition, is the act of self-directed learning. It's when you learn something on your own.
