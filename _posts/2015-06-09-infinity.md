**Infinity is not a number. It's an idea.** It's a concept describing something without any limit; something that goes on forever. The notion and nature of infinity has intrigued mathematicians and philosophers for thousands of years.

The origin of infinity starts with the ancient Greeks and Indians.

## Anaximander (c. 610 BCE — c. 546 BCE)

Anaximander was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher part of the Milesians, a group of philosophers that lived in the city of Miletus in the 6th century BCE. Anaximander and other Milesians were looking for what the world was made of. They called this the _archê_ (ἀρχή — meaning “beginning” or “origin”), written in more detail [here](/matter). In this quest to find the archê, Anaximander introduced the idea of “the Boundless”[^1], called the _apeiron_ (ἄπειρον — meaning “limitless”, “infinite”, “boundless” or “indefinite”). This was the earliest record of the idea of infinity.

## Pythagoras (c. 570 BCE — c. 495 BCE)

Pythagoras is most famous for the Pythagorean theorem, a theorem that states that in a right-angled triangle, the area of the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides.

For a right-angled triangle with two sides of length 1(m/cm/etc), and with the size of the hypotenuse unknown:

Keying √2 on any calculator we can find that its approximate value is 1.41421. Though there exist various algorithms to find an approximate value of the √2 to any desired accuracy, its “exact” value can never be found, since it would require an infinite number of digits.

Pythagoras then discovered irrational numbers as a way to separate out numbers that can be[^5]

## Anaxagoras (c. 500 BCE — c. 428 BCE)

Along with further developing the theories of Anaximenes and Anaximander on the origins of the world, Anaxagoras contended that matter is infinitely divisible. Each piece could be divided into two smaller and smaller portions.

>“There is no smallest among the small and no largest among the large; but always something still smaller and something still larger.”
<br/>– Anaxagoras

## Zeno of Elea (c. 490 BCE — c. 430 BCE)

Zeno was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who found that the concept of infinity was extremely problematic: whenever he introduced real infinite's into the world, he ran into paradoxes.

One of the most famous paradoxes of the nine “Zeno's Paradoxes”[^2] is called “Achilles and the tortoise”. In this paradox, Achilles and a tortoise are in a race. Achilles is the faster runner, so the tortoise is given a 100m head start. When the race starts, Achilles catches us to where the tortoise *was*. But by then, the tortoise has covered another 10m. Achilles now has to sprint another 10m. Since then, the tortoise has moved another 2m, and Achilles has to catch up with the tortoise again. And so on and so forth. Now the paradox is, does Achilles ever actually catch up with the tortoise? Zeno argued that Achilles could never pass the tortoise if infinite's are real. We all know that in the real world, he will catch up with the tortoise!

Summarizing the interesting <cite>Numberphile video</cite>[^3] on the topic:

By subtracting the two of them:

Even though it is an infinite process, you would travel 2m. But **how can an infinite process (a process without a last step) be completed?** This question baffles great minds even to this date.

## Aristotle (c. 384 BCE – c. 322 BCE)

Aristotle was a former star pupil of Plato's. He proposed two senses of the infinite: actual and potential. He decided that *actual* infinity does not exist, and we have to banish that concept to do good science. Instead, we can rely on *potential* infinity, in which more and more elements can always be added, but never infinitely many.[^4]

## Euclid (c. 300 BCE)

Euclid is referred to as the “Father of Geometry”, and was interested in prime numbers. The Greeks noticed that you could split most numbers up into factors, like: 6 = 2 * 3 & 12 = 6 * 2. They also noticed that some numbers couldn't be split, like: 13 = 13 * 1. They called the ones that nothing “goes into” except for 1 and themselves **primes**, and the ones that can be broken up into smaller numbers–and sooner or later turned into primes, **composites**.

> “Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.”
<br/>– Euclid

You can have infinite number of primes!
