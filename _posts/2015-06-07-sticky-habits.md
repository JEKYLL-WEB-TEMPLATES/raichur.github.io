> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
  – Aristotle

Consistently performing behaviors that improve your skills will help you achieve mastery in the long run, so at the beginning of this year I set out to build twelve new habits. Halfway into the year, I’ve been successful so far in forming the habits I set out to form. Here are four things I’ve learnt about habit formation in the process:

1. ### Do it daily and start small
  To make real progress and stick to your habits, it's important to do it **daily**. It's much more useful to make incremental changes every day than to try to spend five hours every other weekend on a habit. Don't make unrealistic daily habit goals; commit to an easy approachable change, and do it every day. Lasting change is a product of daily habits, not overnight conversions.
2. ### Schedule
  Make your habit an essential part of your daily routine. Block off time to work on the habit, or else you may never get to it or will backslide. Eliminate the need to decide whether or not to do the task. Over time, the mental activity required to do the task decreases and the behavior starts becoming automatic.
3. ### Eliminate disruptions and distractions
  If you find yourself backsliding, analyze where you are letting yourself fall through the cracks. For example, if you're unable to wake up early in to morning because you use your phone in bed at night, leave your phone beyond your reach when you go to bed (this may also help prevent you from snoozing your alarm).
4. ### Reward yourself!
  To make sure the habit sticks, it's important to reward yourself every time you finish practicing your habit. Habits can be tough to build, so making your brain crave the reward and trigger the routine is a good way to stick to them.
