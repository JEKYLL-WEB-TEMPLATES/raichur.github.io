> “If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.”
— Peter Marshall

## On The Meaning Of Life
- Life is inherently meaningless.
- It’s okay to create your own meaning.
- My meta-meaning is to experience and learn new things.

## On Personal Conduct
- Be inquisitive.
- Don’t feel sorry for yourself.
- Focus on on tasks that have long-term importance rather than short-term urgency.
- Learn from your mistakes. Be constantly asking yourself “What could I have done better?”.
- Be the change you want to see.
- Follow a daily routine and strive to live a choice-minimal lifestyle.

## On Spirituality
- Superstition is for the ignorant and fearful.

## On Morality
- Discrimination based on sex, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, or any other immutable characteristic is wrong.

## On Health
- Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere.
