# Things I Own

_Last updated: March 31st, 2015._

<br/>

I maintain this list to be more conscious and appreciative of what I own, and reduce and optimize my possessions to only what I really need and frequently use.

<br/>

Rules I followed while developing this list:

- **Pieces of furniture don't count.** I'll be moving out soon anyway.
- **Books don't count.** Though I rarely read physical books anymore, I have a reasonably large-sized physical book collection.
- **Eatables don't count.** They are temporary and frankly too time-consuming to list out.
